### Instructions

**Coding Challenge: NYC Schools**

**GOAL** : Verify candidate can provide a technical solution and follow instructions

**REQUIREMENTS** :

These requirements are rather high-level and vague. If details are omitted, it is because we will be happy with any of a wide variety of solutions. Don&#39;t worry about finding &quot;the&quot; solution. Feel free to be creative with the requirements. Your goal is to impress (but do so with clean code).

Create a browser based or native app to provide information on NYC High schools.

2. It is up to you to decide what additional information to display

**What is Important**

- Proper function â€“ requirements met.
- Well constructed, easy-to-follow, commented code (especially comment hacks or workarounds made in the interest of expediency (i.e. // given more time I would prefer to wrap this in a blah blah blah pattern blah blah )).
- Proper separation of concerns and best-practice coding patterns.
- Defensive code that graciously handles unexpected edge cases.

**What is Less Important**

- Demonstrating technologies or techniques you are not already familiar with.
